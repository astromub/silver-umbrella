Unleash the Scalper: My High-Octane 30-Second Strategy (SMA, Fractals, RCI) 🚀
Hey fellow traders! Are you ready to dive into the lightning-fast world of 30-second candle charts and 3-minute expiries? This isn't for the faint of heart, but with the right tools and a disciplined approach, it can be incredibly rewarding. Today, I'm pulling back the curtain on my go-to scalping strategy, combining classic momentum with trend consistency, and most importantly, integrating the essential risk control of the ASTRONuRi Trade Tracker.

## 1. The Core Indicators in Our Arsenal
This strategy requires extreme responsiveness, so we rely on four highly specialized indicators:

Indicator	Setting	Role in the Strategy
SMA(5) & SMA(10)	5 and 10 periods	Momentum Trigger: Signals the immediate shift in short-term price direction via a crossover.
Fractal Band(2)	2 periods	Dynamic S/R: Identifies recent high/low points that price must respect as short-term support or resistance.
RCI(9) (Rank Correlation Index)	9 periods	Trend Quality Filter: Confirms if the momentum is orderly and consistent (near ±1.0) rather than random noise (near 0).

## 2. The Non-Negotiable Foundation: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation
Trading on 30-second charts without higher timeframe context is pure gambling. We must confirm the overall market direction on a higher chart.

Your Higher Timeframe (HTF): Use a 5-minute chart with a SMA(20).

The Golden Rule: Only look for BUY (Call) opportunities if the 5m price is above the SMA(20). Only look for SELL (Put) opportunities if the 5m price is below the SMA(20).

##  3. The Strategy: When to Hit BUY or SELL
These are the simultaneous conditions that must be met on your 30-second chart for a high-probability entry:

### 🚀 BUY (Call) Signal
Condition	Indicator Confirmation
HTF Filter    	 5m Chart shows a clear Uptrend (Price > SMA 20).
Momentum Shift	 SMA(5) crosses ABOVE SMA(10).
Bounce off Support	Price bounces UP from the recent lower Fractal Band(2).
Orderly Trend	RCI(9) is above the 0 line and rising toward +1.0.
Execution	Enter BUY (Call) at the close of the confirmation candle. Expiry: 3 Minutes.



### 📉 SELL (Put) Signal
Condition	Indicator Confirmation
HTF Filter	5m Chart shows a clear Downtrend (Price < SMA 20).
Momentum Shift	SMA(5) crosses BELOW SMA(10).
Bounce off Resistance	Price bounces DOWN from the recent upper Fractal Band(2).
Orderly Trend	RCI(9) is below the 0 line and falling toward -1.0.
Execution	Enter SELL (Put) at the close of the confirmation candle. Expiry: 3 Minutes.



## 4. 🛡️ Essential Risk Management: Integrating the ASTRONuRi Trade Tracker
In high-speed trading, human emotion is the enemy. You need automated discipline. The ASTRONuRi Trade Tracker is crucial here because it enforces your risk plan without emotion, ensuring a bad streak doesn't wipe you out.

Trade Tracker Risk Workflow
Tracker Feature Used	Your Risk Plan	How it Protects the Strategy
Max Daily Loss (%)	Set to a fixed limit, e.g., -5%.	Protects Capital: The tracker acts as a kill-switch, stopping the trading session instantly if this limit is hit, preventing emotionally charged "revenge trading."
Trade Cost Control	Use the % Capital feature, set to 1% or 2%.	Controls Position Size: Automatically calculates the exact stake needed for your next trade based on your current equity, guaranteeing consistent and safe risk exposure on every 3-minute trade.
LOG WIN / LOG LOSS	Immediately log the outcome after every 3-minute expiry.	Real-Time Monitoring: Instantly updates your Cumulative P/L and Max Loss Left. This ensures you are always aware of your remaining daily risk budget.
Suggested Next Trade Cost	Follow the tracker’s calculated suggestion.	Removes Error: Eliminates manual calculation errors in a time-sensitive environment, ensuring every position adheres to your 1% or 2% risk rule.



The Goal: Let the SMAs, Fractals, and RCI find the trade, but let the ASTRONuRi Trade Tracker enforce the discipline. Never risk more than the tracker permits!

## Conclusion: Discipline Wins the Scalp War
This SMA(5)/SMA(10) + Fractal + RCI(9) strategy is highly effective for capturing short, strong momentum bursts. However, its success hinges on one thing: discipline.

Test this strategy rigorously on a demo account. Set up your ASTRONuRi Trade Tracker limits first. Wait patiently for the Multi-Timeframe confirmation and all four 30-second conditions to align. When they do, trade with confidence, knowing your risk is already controlled.
