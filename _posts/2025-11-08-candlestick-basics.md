# 🕯️ Candlestick Basics for Binary Traders

Candlestick charts are the foundation of price action analysis. Whether you're trading binary options, forex, or crypto, understanding candlesticks helps you spot trends, reversals, and key decision zones.

## 📘 What Is a Candlestick?

Each candlestick represents **price movement over a specific time period** (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes). It shows:

- **Open**: Price at the start of the candle
- **Close**: Price at the end of the candle
- **High**: Highest price reached
- **Low**: Lowest price reached

### 🟩 Bullish Candle
- Close > Open
- Candle body is typically **green**
- Indicates upward momentum

### 🟥 Bearish Candle
- Close < Open
- Candle body is typically **red**
- Indicates downward momentum

## 🔍 How to Read Candlesticks

| Component     | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| **Body**      | Strength of the move (long body = strong move) |
| **Wicks**     | Price rejection zones (long wick = reversal risk) |
| **Color**     | Direction (green = bullish, red = bearish) |

> ✅ Strong candles with small wicks = high conviction  
> ⚠️ Doji or spinning tops = indecision

## 🧠 Common Candlestick Types

## 🧱 Support and Resistance

### 🔍 How to Spot Them
